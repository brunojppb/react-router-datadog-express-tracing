Rename package to support [React Router 7](https://reactrouter.com/)

This is a major change in this package given that I've chosen to rename it
to be more compatible with React Router 7.

The API is exactly the same, but we now have React Router 7 as a peer dependency instead.

Please, refer to our README on how to integrate this package on your React Router app.

If you are running Remix, use the last version of this package [here on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remix-datadog-express-tracing).
